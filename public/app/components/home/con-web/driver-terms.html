            <h5>PART A - BOOKING AND LIABILITY TERMS</h5>
<ol>
    <li>BOOKING PROCESS</li>
    <ol>
        <li>MoversPro provides the use of the Site and as the Courier’s disclosed agent to enable a Courier (acting as principal)    to enter into a contract for courier services within the United Kingdom with you pursuant to the Courier Terms. Use of the Site gives rise to a contract between you and a Courier for the courier services. For the avoidance of doubt, MoversPro is not a courier and is acting only as an intermediary between you and the courier. You acknowledge that the contract for courier services is pursuant to the Courier Terms in Part B and that MoversPro is acting as the Courier’s agent in facilitating the booking with the Courier.</li>
<li>The MoversPro services allow you access quotations from and send items via a number of vetted quality bicycle, motorbike, motor vehicle or “on foot” couriers that have registered with us.   In these terms of use, we refer to these courier companies as the “Courier”.</li>
<li> When you make a Quote Request on the Site, you will be provided with a range of Quotes from Couriers to choose from during the Acceptance Period.</li>
<li>Our website allows for the automated placing of orders between you and a Courier without any human intervention by MoversPro.  We do not 'check' your Quote Request before it is placed with the Couriers.  It is therefore essential that the order is correctly entered and declared in order for the correct Services and pricing to be displayed. Quotes will be based on the information you provide when placing your Quote Request. </li>
<li> MoversPro is not obliged to provide Quotes when you make a Quote Request. A contract for the Courier Services will only be formed when you make a Quote Acceptance within the Acceptance Period specified with each such Quote. At this stage the payment will be processed. MoversPro reserves the right to refuse and cancel any order and operate sophisticated Payment & Fraud security checks.</li>
<li> MoversPro, on behalf of Couriers, only accepts customers who are UK residents, who must be the end user and not another third party broker. A UK registered card or Stripe Account must be used to purchase in order to ensure VAT is applied correctly and any refunds / credits due can be applied.</li>
<li> You have the right to withdraw from the order process up to the point of clicking upon a Quote Acceptance. Once a Quote Acceptance is clicked, the contract for the Services with the Courier is entered into and the payment process will take place. The MoversPro website handles the payments to the Courier on your behalf. In addition, should that Service not be available once purchased you will be immediately contacted with a right to cancel.</li>
<li> MoversPro ensures that Couriers providing Quotes have been vetted, approved and registered with MoversPro. </li>
<li> On accepting a Quote you will be provided with a picture and unique reference code for the Courier. </li>
<li> MoversPro track item/goods by available GPS tracking, which updates at each stage of the journey (pick up, collection, delivery) to show the Courier’s progress, but not ongoing real time movement. </li>
<li> MoversPro reserves the right to suspend your ability and right to use the Services and/or or terminate your use of the Website and Service where:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>We find evidence of or suspect fraud on the part of the Customer;</li>
            <li> We find a pattern of losses or claims for Consignments;</li>
            <li> We consider your behaviour damaging the reputation of Jasmine or the MoversPro brand;</li>
            <li> you are in breach of any other breach of the terms of this Agreement;</li>
            <li> you attempt to hire a MoversPro courier whether on an ad hoc basis, or a permanent or temporary role, in such a way to avoid paying for the job (or jobs) via the MoversPro website, without our express written permission; or</li>
            <li> for any other reason at our absolute discretion we decide to suspend or terminate your use of the Website and/or Service.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>LIABILITY</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The services are provided ‘as is’ and ‘as available’. MoversPro disclaims all representations and warranties, express or implied, or statutory, not expressly set out in these terms, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non infringement. In addition, MoversPro makes no representation, warranty, or guarantee regarding the reliability, timeliness, quality, suitability, or availability of the services or any services or goods requested through the use of the services, or that services will be uninterrupted or error-free. MoversPro does not guarantee the quality, suitability, safety or ability of third party providers. You agree that the entire risk arising out of your use of the services, and any service or good requested in connection therewith, remains solely with you, the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. </li>
        <li> MoversPro accepts no liability for any claim of loss of or damages to any goods suffered whilst in the possession of any of our registered independent contractors. </li>
        <li> Any claims to damage and/or losses must be made to the service provider directly, within 7 days of the service. </li>
        <li> Nothing in this section seeks to limit MoversPro's or the Courier’s liability to you for claims relating to death or personal injury caused by MoversPro's or the Courier’s negligence or for any other liability which cannot be excluded by law. </li>
        <li> In any case, to the greatest extent that is permitted by law and save in the event of our or the Courier’s wilful misconduct, MoversPro hereby limits its liability to the direct losses suffered by you (save as expressly stated otherwise in these terms of use).  Accordingly, we will not be liable for any claim for loss of profit, loss of use of an item, loss of revenue, repair valuations, administrative, inconvenience, delay, disappointment, or indirect or consequential loss or damage arising out of, or in relation to, the service you ordered.</li>
        <li> MoversPro accepts no liability for loss or damage to Excluded Items. These include Prohibited Items, which you are not entitled to send using our Service and other items you are entitled to send but in respect of which we exclude all liability. </li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<h6>Limitation of liability.</h6>
<p>MoversPro shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including lost profits, lost data, personal injury, or property damage related to, in connection with, or otherwise resulting from any use of the services, even if MoversPro has been advised of the possibility of such damages. MoversPro shall not be liable for any damages, liability or losses arising out of: (i) your use of or reliance on the services or your inability to access or use the services; or (ii) any transaction or relationship between you and any third party provider, even if MoversPro has been advised of the possibility of such damages. MoversPro shall not be liable for delay or failure in performance resulting from causes beyond MoversPro's reasonable control. You acknowledge that third party transportation providers providing transportation services requested through some request brands may offer ridesharing or peer-to-peer transportation services and may not be professionally licensed or permitted. In no event shall MoversPro's total liability to you in connection with the services for all damages, losses and causes of action exceed one hundred GBP Great British Pounds (UK £100).
MoversPro's services may be used by you to request and schedule transportation, goods, or logistics services with third party providers, but you agree that MoversPro has no responsibility or liability to you related to any transportation, goods or logistics services provided to you by third party providers other than as expressly set forth in these terms.
The limitations and disclaimer in this section 5 do not purport to limit liability or alter your rights as a consumer that cannot be excluded under applicable law.</p>

    <h5>PART B - COURIER TERMS</h5>
            <p>These terms for the contract between you and the Courier for the provision of the Courier Services.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>COLLECTION OF CONSIGNMENTS</li>
                <ol>

                <li>The collection of a Consignment will normally occur on your chosen date and time. Any Quote Request can be withdrawn/cancelled. You are not obliged to accept any of the Quotes.  However, if after you have made a Quote Acceptance and you cancel prior to or at any time up to collection when the Courier attempts collection, a cancellation fee of 50% of the Fee will apply. Once a Consignment has been collected from you, your order cannot be cancelled and the full fee is payable, which will be doubled if the consignment is required to be returned to the sender. Upon a Quote Acceptance, you agree to the provision of Services to you and accordingly from the point of collection you will not be able to exercise any legal cancellation right that you may have (also known as a 'cooling off' right) from the point when the Consignment is collected from you).</li>
                <li> Collection dates and times are not guaranteed. If the Courier is not able to collect by the time set out in your Order the Courier will endeavour to notify you of the revised collection time as soon as possible. If no courier is available at time of request, MoversPro bears no responsibility of completion of the consignment, and no liability of any losses suffered as a result thereof.</li>
                <li>In the rare event that the Courier is at fault for not collecting the Consignment, please contact the Courier immediately to arrange redelivery, free of charge. If you are at fault for the collection not being made, any such redelivery will be a new Order and will be charged a full Fee and the aborted collection will be charged a 50% cancellation fee. Please be aware that we are not aware of any issues with collection until the Courier is contacted.</li>
                <li> Your Consignment must be packed to a reasonable standard to protect the contents. The packaging must also be sufficient to protect the Consignment's weight.  It is not always obvious when a Consignment has not been packaged properly. The Couriers will assume that Consignments have been correctly packaged and will exercise a level of skill and care appropriate to that. Any claim resulting from an item/goods that is/are not packaged to a reasonable standard and in line with the above may be declined. For further details see section 12 below.</li>
                <li>Please note that all Consignments must be able to withstand a short drop, very fragile items should not be sent though the Courier Services. </li>
                <li>Prohibited Items should not be sent using the Courier Services.  If they are sent using the Courier services, the affected item could be subject to delay, return, or held for collection by you or the receiver. If the Consignment is held to be collected, you will be notified that collection of said Consignment must be arranged by a certain date or the goods may incur storage charges and finally discarded. To clarify, the Consignment may be discarded if i) they are damaged to such an extent that it is a Health and Safety risk (such as smashed glass); in which case you would be notified of this or ii) if they have been held for collection for a fixed time limit and the time limit advised has been exceeded.</li>
                <li> Any item/goods should not be strapped or attached together. This is not a secure way for item/goods to travel. Any item that is not securely packaged or is strapped to another package will be treated as a Prohibited Item (see section 11 for further information).</li>
                <li> The Courier has the right to refuse a Consignment for a reasonable reason such as no packaging, insufficient packaging or the Consignment does not comply with the information given by you at the time of placing the order - for example is not labelled correctly, contains a Prohibited item or is larger/heavier than stated. In such circumstances the Cancellation Fee shall be payable</li>
                <li>Collections are possible 24/7/365, but are subject to Courier availability in providing Quotes to meet your Quote Request requirements. </li>
                <li> Please ensure the collection and drop offs points are available at the collection time that you request. If there is any issue with an address being difficult to find, or not on a typical GPS map, it is your responsibility to ensure the driver is able to find it.  A charge of (a) 50% of the Fee otherwise unavailable when the Courier tries to collect or (b) 100% of the fee. For further information, please see section 4.</li>
                <li>It is your responsibility to ensure the person handing over the Consignment gives it to the correct Courier. MoversPro and the Courier accepts no liability for loss, damage or theft of a Consignment as a result of the Consignment being given to anyone other than the correct Courier. </li>
                <li> On collection of your Consignment the Courier will update the status of the Order as “collected” in your Account.  This will be proof of collection as required for any issues that you may have with the Consignment or processing of your order. </li>
                <li>It is your responsibility to ensure that all the details are correctly completed and displayed on the correct Consignment as delivery will be made to the details listed on the Consignment.  It is not the Courier's responsibility to check this information, so please ensure this is checked before he leaves. </li>
                </ol>

        <li>DELIVERY</li>
        <ol>
            <li> Delivery dates and times are not guaranteed.</li>
<li> Delivery times quoted are calculated from once collection is made and the consignment is in Transit.  For example, if a 'next day' guaranteed service is ordered, the 'next day' will be calculated from the date that the Consignment is collected.</li>
<li> Deliveries are possible 24/7/365, but are subject to Courier availability in providing Quotes to meet your Quote Request requirements. </li>
<li> The Courier will endeavour to notify you by email, text and/or phone call if there are any issues with delivery so as to try to ensure the delivery can occur, even where you have not complied with the delivery order details. </li>
<li> Couriers can only deliver to a full street address. The Courier cannot deliver to a PO Box or BFPO address.  If a Consignment has to be returned for this reason, no refund will be given. Also, the Return Charge will apply.</li>
<li> Deliveries will be made to the address on the item, main front door, reception or goods in. The Couriers will not deliver to individual department or Block numbers. Deliveries may be made to a neighbouring address if the agreed delivery method is not possible. </li>
<li>A telephone number for the receiver is required for each Consignment (for example so that the receiver can be called in the event of an address query).  Couriers will not redeliver or refund any returned item if a telephone number has not been provided and the Courier has been unable to arrange delivery because a phone number has not been provided.</li>
<li> Couriers will call/email/text you if the method of delivery is not possible when they arrive at the delivery point, in order to enable the delivery to be made. After making such reasonable attempts, the Courier has the right to return the unsuccessful Consignment to the sender. The Admin Charge will apply before return. </li>
<li>The Courier Services are offered “door to door”. This means that a Courier will arrange for pick up from one address and a drop off at another. If the Consignee is out goods may be left with a neighbour if they are available to receive. </li>
<li> Where delivery is being made and the Courier accepts that no person will be able to receive the Consignment (such as leaving the Consignment at an unmanned address), the Courier shall not be liable for any claims that the Consignment was not delivered where the Courier has confirmed in real time that the Consignment was delivered.</li>
        </ol>
            <li>SURCHARGES</li>
        <ol>
            <li> Certain surcharges may be payable by you to the Courier in addition to the carriage fees which are set out as the cost for the standard delivery of your order. When a surcharge is payable, it may be charged directly to the payment method used to make the initial order (and you hereby authorise the automated payment of such charges). If we have not obtained your consent to charge surcharges directly to your original payment method, we will contact you directly to arrange payment.</li>
            <li> Any Surcharges represent the additional administrative costs which will be suffered by the Courier in connection with the Courier Services respectively and charges which MoversPro may incur are not penalties imposed by the Courier.  We act on behalf of the Courier as agent for the purpose of collecting any surcharges. This information is made available to you prior to placing your order.</li>
            <li>For illustrative purposes, the following is a non-exhaustive list of when surcharges may be payable.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> A charge of 50% of the Fee (instead of the full Fee) will be applied if, when the Courier tries to collect the Consignment and it is unavailable for collection after the Courier has waited no less than 15 minutes from the proposed collection time and the Courier’s attempts to contact you have failed or confirmed the collection cannot be made when scheduled. </li>
            <li> A surcharge of 100% of the Fee (in addition to the Fee remaining payable) may be applied when the Courier tries to deliver the Consignment and is unable to deliver in accordance with the Order, after the Courier’s attempts to contact you have failed or it has been confirmed the collection cannot be made when scheduled.  If the Courier has attempted delivery within the window required by you and it is not deliverable, you will be liable for and charged the surcharge. If however, the Courier has missed the required delivery window then you will not be liable for the surcharge.</li>
            <li> A surcharge of 100% of the Fee (in addition to the Fee remaining payable) will be applied if the receiver refuses to take delivery of the goods and they need to be sent back to the collection point or if it is not in the reasonable opinion of the Courier possible to leave the Consignment in a safe place at the point of delivery. </li>
            <li>3.4. By choosing the van for your Consignment on the site you are prepaying for the postage. On receiving the job details before they quote for the work the Courier will be making a judgment as to whether they have room to take the Consignment. Accordingly, it is important to be accurate. If the Consignment is considered too heavy or large to be reasonably handled by the Courier or vehicle, the Courier is entitled to refuse to take the Consignment and a Cancellation Fee of 50% of the Fee will be payable (instead of the full fee payable)</li>
